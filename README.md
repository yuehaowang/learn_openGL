# Let's CG

A collection of essential algorithms and applications for rendering and geometry processing in the area of computer graphics, including OpenGL, global illumination, volume rendering, Loop subdivision, convex hull, etc.

- Author: Yuehao Wang
- This project is a compilation of my assignments and projects in the Computer Graphics course (CS171) instructed by [Prof. Xiaopei Liu](http://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/liuxp/).

## Subprojects

- [OpenGL](https://github.com/yuehaowang/OpenGL_grocery)

    Includes rasterization, coordinate transformation, texture mapping, normal mapping and Phong shading.

- [Loop Subdivision](https://github.com/yuehaowang/lets_CG/tree/master/loop_subdivision)

    An implementation of Loop subdivision algorithm.

- [Convex Hull 3D](https://github.com/yuehaowang/convex_hull_3d)

    Includes 3D convex hull algorithms and SAT collision detection.

- [Global Illumination](https://github.com/yuehaowang/global_illumination)

    Implements ray tracing, Marte Carlo integral, grid acceleration structure, and importance sampling.

- [Volume Rendering](https://github.com/yuehaowang/lets_CG/tree/master/volume_rendering)

    A basic volume renderer with ray sampler, tri-linear/nearest-neighbor interpolation, transfer function and backward/forward composition.

- [CUDA Volume Renderer](https://github.com/yuehaowang/volume_renderer)

    An interactive volume visualizer powered by CUDA.
